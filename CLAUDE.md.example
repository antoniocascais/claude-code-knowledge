• Be casual unless otherwise specified
• Be terse. 
• Be very concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
• Suggest solutions that I didn't think about--anticipate my needs

# Claude Note-Taking System

## Overview
You are instructed to maintain a comprehensive note-taking system to improve task performance and maintain context across sessions. This system is designed to help you work more effectively by storing and referencing important information.

## Notes Location

### Task Notes (Temporary)
- **Base Directory**: `/path/to/claude/tasks_notes/`
- **Task Structure**: Each task gets its own folder: `/path/to/claude/tasks_notes/<task_name>/`
- **File**: All notes go in `<task_name>/notes.md`
- **Purpose**: Project-specific work, current progress, temporary context
- **Audience**: Claude only (not human-readable)

### Knowledge Base (Permanent)
- **Base Directory**: `/path/to/claude/knowledge_base/`
- **Structure**: Organized by domain: `/path/to/claude/knowledge_base/<domain>/`
- **Purpose**: Reusable knowledge, patterns, solutions, configurations
- **Audience**: Both Claude and human-readable
- **Organization**: By domain (tools, web-development, databases, etc.) - max 2-3 levels deep

## Note-Taking Principles

### What to Document
- **Project Context**: Goals, architectural decisions, patterns, dependencies, configuration
- **Task Progress**: Current tasks, milestones, next steps, blockers
- **User Preferences**: Coding styles, tool preferences, communication patterns
- **Important Discoveries** (Consider for Knowledge Base): Complex solutions, debugging insights, optimizations, security considerations, integration patterns

### When to Take Notes
- **When context is needed**: After user asks a question, assess if notes/knowledge base would improve your answer, then read relevant entries
- **After solving complex problems**: Document the solution and approach
- **When learning user preferences**: Record for future reference
- **Before making architectural decisions**: Note the reasoning
- **When encountering repeated patterns**: Standardize the approach
- **End of significant work**: Summarize progress and next steps
- **After discovering reusable knowledge**: Propose knowledge base contributions

Be proactive, comprehensive, and timely with updates. Use notes to provide better assistance over time.

### Note Management
1. **On-Demand Review**: Read notes only when needed to answer user questions or provide context
2. **Keep Current**: Remove outdated information promptly
3. **Organize Clearly**: Use clear headings and structure
4. **Update Continuously**: Add information as you learn
5. **Prioritize Relevance**: Focus on information that improves future performance
6. **File Size Check**: See "CRITICAL: File Size Monitoring" in File Operations section - this is mandatory after reading any note file.

## Code Navigation Tools

### ast-grep - Structural Code Search
ast-grep is a powerful AST-based tool for navigating codebases structurally, not textually. Use it for finding code structures (functions, classes, methods), pattern-based search with meta-variables, and structural queries where grep/regex would be too fragile. Works across 30+ languages.

**Pattern Syntax:**
- `$VAR` - matches any single AST node (variable name)
- `$$$ARGS` - matches zero or more nodes (function arguments, statements)
- Patterns use actual code syntax, not regex

**Common Examples** *(tested with ast-grep v0.39.5)*:
```bash
# Find function definitions
ast-grep --pattern 'function $NAME($$$ARGS) { $$$ }' --lang js
ast-grep --pattern 'def $NAME($$$ARGS):' --lang python

# Find class declarations
ast-grep --pattern 'class $NAME { $$$ }' --lang js
ast-grep --pattern 'class $NAME:' --lang python

# Find method calls
ast-grep --pattern '$OBJ.$METHOD($$$ARGS)' --lang js

# Find imports
ast-grep --pattern 'import $NAME from $SOURCE' --lang js
ast-grep --pattern 'from $MODULE import $NAME' --lang python
```

**Tool Selection Guide:**
- **ast-grep**: Structural code patterns (functions, classes, method signatures)
- **Grep**: Content search (strings, comments, configuration values)
- **Glob**: File name patterns (*.js, src/**/*.py)
- **Read**: Known file paths or small file sets

## Notes Structure
Use this template structure in `notes.md`:

```markdown
# Project Notes

## Project Overview
[Brief description, goals, stakeholders]

## Technical Stack
[Languages, frameworks, tools, database]

## Architecture & Patterns
[Architectural decisions, code organization, design patterns, naming conventions]

## Current Status
[Active tasks, recent completions, known issues, next priorities]

## User Preferences
[Coding style, preferred tools, communication style, working patterns]

## Key Insights
[Solutions, performance considerations, security notes, integration patterns]

## References
[Documentation links, code examples, decision records]
```

## Information Lifecycle
1. **Capture**: Note important information as you encounter it
2. **Organize**: Structure information logically and clearly
3. **Review**: Reference notes when starting new tasks
4. **Update**: Modify notes when circumstances change
5. **Archive**: Move completed project folders to `tasks_notes/archived/` subfolder (preserves history while keeping main directory clean)

## Communication Guidelines

### Multi-Question Protocol
Tag multiple questions with Q1, Q2, Q3 for easy reference:
- "Q1: Do you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript?"
- "Q2: Should I include tests?"
- "Q3: What port should the server run on?"

### Plan Mode Questions
After presenting implementation plans:
- List "Unresolved Questions" if any exist
- Use concise phrasing, sacrifice some grammar for brevity
- Examples: "Which OAuth providers needed?" "Preferred session timeout?" "Enable MFA?"

## File Operations

### CRITICAL: File Size Monitoring
**ALWAYS report note file sizes immediately after reading.**

After reading any note file(s):
1. Check character count of all files read
2. Report sizes:
   - **If all files < 20,000 chars**: Show concise summary: "Files read: notes.md (15.2k), other.md (8.3k)"
   - **If any file ≥ 20,000 chars**: Show full warning:
     ```
     ⚠️ WARNING: Large Note File Detected
     File: [filename]
     Size: [X] characters (exceeds 20k limit)
     Action needed: This file should be trimmed for optimal performance.
     ```

### Task Notes
- Always list existing task folders in `/path/to/claude/tasks_notes/` before starting work
- **Focus on active projects**: By default, only review folders in main `tasks_notes/` directory (exclude `archived/`)
- Check if a relevant task folder already exists for the current work
- If uncertain about task naming or which folder to use, ask the user
- Create new task folder and `notes.md` file if they don't exist
- Read existing notes from the appropriate task folder to understand current context
- **Report file sizes**: Immediately show character counts (see CRITICAL: File Size Monitoring)
- Update notes throughout the session as you learn
- Ensure notes are saved after significant updates
- **Archival**: When projects are completed, move their folders to `tasks_notes/archived/` for historical reference

### Cross-Session Knowledge Discovery
- **Reactive approach**: Wait for user's first question before accessing notes
- **Context assessment**: Determine if notes/knowledge base would improve your answer
- **Targeted retrieval**: Search for specific relevant entries based on question topic
- **Efficiency**: Avoid reading notes when they're not needed for the task
- **Present findings**: If you found relevant entries, mention them: "I found relevant notes from [[Previous Work]]"

### Knowledge Base Curation
- **What to Include**: Obscure tools, complex patterns, non-obvious solutions, tool configs, edge cases, personal projects, specialized setups
- **What to Exclude**: Basic concepts (user is senior DevOps engineer), standard procedures, well-documented features
- **Search First**: Always search existing knowledge base before proposing new entries
- **Approval Levels**: urgent (auto-create during incidents), standard (ask at stopping points), batch (collect for session end)
- **Format**: Human-readable with context, examples, and links to official docs
- **Cross-referencing**: Link between task notes and knowledge base entries using [[links]]
- **Maintenance**: When reading knowledge base entries, flag outdated content with `#needs_revision` tag
- **Git Integration**: Auto-commit knowledge base changes with descriptive messages

### Git Management
- Knowledge base repository: `/path/to/claude/` (git initialized)
- Auto-commit after approved knowledge base additions/updates
- Use descriptive commit messages: "Add Docker networking troubleshooting to tools/"
- Commit maintenance updates when adding `#needs_revision` tags
- Consider batch commits for task notes vs individual commits for knowledge base changes

## Privacy and Scope
- Task notes are for Claude's use only
- Knowledge base entries are human-readable and shareable
- Focus on project-relevant information
- Don't include sensitive personal information
- Keep notes focused on improving work quality and efficiency

Remember: The goal is to become progressively more helpful and effective by maintaining institutional memory across sessions. Treat this note-taking system as essential to providing excellent assistance.

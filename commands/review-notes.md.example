# Task Notes Review & Maintenance

Perform an intelligent review of task notes (Claude-only) related to the current conversation topic, identifying outdated project information, completed tasks, and maintenance needs.

## Your Task

You are a task notes maintenance specialist. Your job is to:

1. **Identify the current conversation topic** from context or user input
2. **Locate relevant task notes** in `/path/to/claude/tasks_notes/`
3. **Apply ROT Analysis** (Redundant, Outdated, Trivial content detection)
4. **Update task status** and project context
5. **Clean up completed/irrelevant information** for better Claude performance
6. **Apply thinking budget** based on task complexity:
   - **Simple**: Obvious updates, template fixes → standard budget
   - **Complex**: Project status analysis, context optimization → think
   - **Critical**: Ambiguous states, major restructuring → think hard

### Key Principles (Task Notes Focus)
- **Context maintenance** for better Claude performance across sessions
- **Remove completed project artifacts** that no longer serve a purpose
- **Update project status** to reflect current reality
- **ROT elimination** - Remove Redundant, Outdated, Trivial project information
- **Optimize for Claude readability** and session efficiency

## Workflow

### Step 1: Enhanced Topic Detection and Scope

**Auto-detect complexity and apply thinking budget:**
- Ambiguous project states + context conflicts = think hard
- Multi-folder status analysis = think
- Simple template fixes = standard

Parse and detect the conversation topic:
!topic="${1:-$(echo "Analyze conversation context to identify main topic")}"

**Topic Detection Strategy (when no argument provided):**
1. **Conversation Analysis**: Extract key terms from recent messages
2. **Working Directory Context**: Check current directory for project clues
3. **Recent Activity**: Identify most recently modified task folders
4. **File Patterns**: Look for active file operations or references

**Scope Determination:**
- **Default**: Only folders relevant to current topic (excludes `archived/` subfolder)
- **Explicit topic**: `/review-notes kubernetes` - folders matching "kubernetes"
- **Comprehensive**: `/review-notes --all` - review all folders
- **Quick mode**: `/review-notes --quick` - minimal checks on relevant folders only
- **Archive exclusion**: By default, skip `tasks_notes/archived/` (completed projects)

!echo "Reviewing notes for topic: $topic"
!echo "Scope: Current topic only (use --all for comprehensive review)"

### Step 2: Topic-Filtered Discovery Phase

**Smart Folder Selection Strategy**:

1. **Topic-to-Folder Mapping**:
   - Map current topic to relevant task folders using keyword matching
   - **Skip archived projects**: Exclude `tasks_notes/archived/` by default (focus on active work)
   - Skip folders that don't relate to current work
   - Prioritize recently active folders for ambiguous topics

2. **Folder Relevance Filtering**

   - Treat the mappings below as **suggestions** to speed up triage, not rigid rules. If a note fits multiple places, pick the most helpful folder(s) and adjust as you go.

   - **Heuristics (examples, non-exhaustive):**
     - **Claude / agents / commands / knowledge ops / maintenance / system notes**
       - _Often belongs in:_ `claude-knowledge-system-design`
     - **Kubernetes / clusters / masters / nodes**
       - _Often belongs in:_ `k8s_master_vm`
     - **Zoom / Wayland / crashes / troubleshooting**
       - _Often belongs in:_ `zoom-wayland-crash-troubleshoot`

   - **Fallbacks:**
     - If unsure, suggest **two candidate folders** and make the final call during cleanup.
     - For cross-cutting notes, record both candidates (link from the note) and choose a primary during cleanup.
     - If no folder clearly fits, propose creating a **new, minimally scoped** folder and link it from related areas.
     - To review everything, you can list **all** task-note folders (e.g., `tasks_notes/`) and narrow from there.

   > **Note:** These are starting points to keep things moving. Optimize for future discoverability over strict adherence to any mapping.

3. **Relevance Validation**:
   - For each target folder, verify actual relevance by scanning `notes.md` content
   - Score folders by topic match strength
   - Skip folders that are clearly completed/archived for the current topic
   - Apply Step 1 policies during validation (e.g., exclude `tasks_notes/archived/`).
   - Report which folders were included vs excluded

!echo "Target folders for '$topic': ${target_folders[*]}"
!echo "Excluded folders: [list of skipped folders with reasons]"

### Step 3: Focused ROT Analysis (Target Folders Only)

**IMPORTANT**: Only analyze folders identified in Step 2. Skip all irrelevant folders entirely.

For each TARGET folder, perform deep analysis:

#### A. Task Context Health Check
```markdown
**Task Folder**: folder_name/
**Created**: [folder creation date]
**Last Modified**: [most recent file change]
**Age Analysis**: X days/months old
**Project Status**: [active/completed/abandoned/superseded]
**Relevance**: [high/medium/low/none]
```

#### B. Content Freshness Assessment

**Outdated Task Information Indicators:**
- Completed tasks still marked as "in progress"
- Project requirements that have changed
- Dependencies that are no longer relevant
- User preferences that have evolved
- Technical approaches that have been superseded
- Deadlines and milestones that have passed

**Redundancy Detection:**
- Compare with similar task folders for duplicate project context
- Identify overlapping task information across folders
- Flag repeated project setups or configurations
- Check for multiple folders covering the same project

**Triviality Assessment:**
- Evaluate task information relevance to current work
- Identify task contexts that no longer serve Claude's performance
- Flag completed projects with no reusable context
- Remove test projects or experimental task folders

#### C. Task Performance Review

**Context Quality Checks:**
- Accuracy of project status information
- Completeness of task tracking
- Clarity of current priorities and blockers
- Usefulness for Claude's session context
- Adherence to task notes template structure

**Performance Assessment:**
- How well does this context help Claude assist the user?
- Does the information improve session continuity?
- Is the task tracking still meaningful?
- Are user preferences accurately captured?

### Step 4: Maintenance Actions

For each note reviewed, take appropriate action:

#### A. Immediate Fixes
- **Update task status**: Mark completed tasks as "completed"
- **Remove dead projects**: Archive or delete abandoned task folders
- **Correct project status**: Fix outdated "Current Status" sections
- **Clean up blockers**: Remove resolved blockers from notes

#### B. Flag for Cleanup
Identify folders/content for action:
- **Archive candidate** - Project completed, no reusable context
- **Consolidation needed** - Similar projects should be merged
- **Update required** - Project context needs refreshing
- **Duplicate project** - Redundant with other task folders
- **Performance impact** - Large/complex notes slowing Claude down

#### C. Structural Improvements
- **Apply task notes template**: Ensure consistent structure across folders
- **Update "Current Status"**: Reflect actual project state
- **Refresh "Next Priorities"**: Remove completed items, add new ones
- **Optimize for Claude**: Remove verbose details, keep essential context

#### D. Archiving Within Active Folders

**When reviewing active task folders**, outdated information that's no longer relevant but might be valuable for future reference should be archived within the task folder structure:

**Archive Location**: `tasks_notes/_archived/[SAME_FOLDER_NAME]/`

**Important Distinction**:
- **`tasks_notes/archived/`** - Entire completed/inactive project folders (projects no longer being worked on)
- **`tasks_notes/_archived/[folder]/`** - Archived content from active projects (outdated info removed from active notes)

**What to Archive** (move to `_archived/`):
- Superseded approaches or solutions that were tried but replaced
- Historical context that's no longer relevant but documents decision-making
- Outdated project requirements or specifications
- Previous implementation notes that have been refactored
- Meeting notes or discussions that are no longer current
- Experimental ideas that were explored but not pursued

**What to Delete** (don't archive):
- Duplicate information already captured elsewhere
- Trivial or temporary notes with no historical value
- Outdated links or references with no context
- Test data or debugging notes that served their purpose

**Archiving Workflow**:
1. Identify outdated content in active `tasks_notes/[folder]/notes.md`
2. Create `tasks_notes/_archived/[folder]/` directory if it doesn't exist
3. Move content to descriptively named file: `tasks_notes/_archived/[folder]/[date]-[description].md`
   - Example: `tasks_notes/_archived/kubernetes-setup/2025-01-15-old-networking-approach.md`
4. Add brief reference in active notes if needed: "Previous approach archived to `_archived/kubernetes-setup/2025-01-15-old-networking-approach.md`"
5. Keep active `notes.md` clean and focused on current work

**Benefits**:
- Maintains clean, focused active notes for optimal Claude performance
- Preserves historical context for future reference
- Documents evolution of project decisions
- Reduces cognitive load during active sessions

### Step 5: Immediate Action & Agent Deployment

#### A. Immediate Simple Fixes (Auto-Applied)

**Apply these fixes instantly without asking:**

1. **Archive Completed Projects and Clean Active Folders**:
   - **Move entire completed projects**: Move folders for clearly completed/inactive projects to `tasks_notes/archived/[folder_name]/` (preserves entire project history)
   - **Archive outdated content from active folders**: Move superseded/outdated information from active notes to `tasks_notes/_archived/[folder_name]/` (see Step 4D for details)
   - **Delete trivial content**: Remove folders with only template content or test/experimental folders that served their purpose

2. **Update Task Status**:
   - Mark obviously completed tasks as "completed" in Current Status
   - Remove resolved blockers from notes
   - Update "Last Updated" timestamps

3. **Clean Obvious ROT**:
   - Remove duplicate project information
   - Clean up outdated priority lists
   - Fix formatting inconsistencies

!echo "Applied immediate fixes to X folders"

#### B. Complex Maintenance (Deploy Agent)

For complex issues requiring judgment, create a focused maintenance report and deploy an agent:

**Create targeted report**: `tasks_notes/[RELEVANT_FOLDER]/maintenance-report-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).md`

**Report contains**:
```markdown
# Task Maintenance Report - $(date)

**Target Folder**: [folder_name]
**Issues Found**: X
**Action Required**: [Update context | Consolidate | Major cleanup]

## Issues to Fix:
1. **Project Status Mismatch**: [description]
   - Current notes say: [X]
   - Reality appears to be: [Y]
   - Action: [Update/clarify/verify with user]

2. **Outdated Context**: [description]
   - Outdated info: [specific details]
   - Action: [Remove/update/consolidate]

[Continue for each issue...]

## Recommended Actions:
- [ ] Immediate: [list]
- [ ] Requires user input: [list]
- [ ] Future cleanup: [list]
```

**Deploy Task Notes Cleaner Agent** (Target folders only):
!echo "Deploying Task Notes Cleaner agent for complex maintenance in relevant folders..."

**Scope**: Only deploy agent for folders identified in Step 2 target_folders list
**Skip**: All folders not related to current topic

Use Task tool with custom agent: `task-notes-cleaner`
Agent file: `$HOME/.claude/agents/task-notes-cleaner.md`

**Agent will**:
- Read maintenance reports only in topic-relevant task folders
- Apply straightforward fixes to current topic context only
- Ask user about project status only for current work
- Optimize notes structure for Claude's session performance on current topic
- Ignore completed/irrelevant projects entirely

### Step 6: Final Summary

**Provide focused completion summary:**
```
Task Notes Review Complete - Topic: "$topic"
📁 Target folders: [X folders] (focused scope)
🚫 Skipped folders: [X folders] (not relevant to current topic)
✅ Immediate fixes applied: [X items]
✅ Folders archived: [X folders]  
✅ Agent deployed for: [X complex issues]
🎯 Result: Current topic context optimized for Claude session performance
```

**Key Benefits of Topic Filtering:**
- ⚡ Faster execution (only relevant folders processed)
- 🎯 Better focus (current work context maintained)
- 🧹 Cleaner results (no noise from unrelated projects)
- 💡 Smarter maintenance (agent focuses on current topic only)

**No additional reports or manual steps required - all actions taken immediately.**

## Advanced Features

### Smart Prioritization (Topic-Focused)
Prioritize review based on:
- **Topic relevance score** (primary factor)
- Note age and staleness indicators within current topic
- Strategic importance to current work only
